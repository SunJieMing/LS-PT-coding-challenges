You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.


1. Fill the five-quart jug full.
2. Pour that into the three-quart jug. Now the five-quart jug has two quarts.
3. Empty out the three-quart jug.
4. Pour the contents of the five-quart jug into the three-quart jug. It is now one quart empty.
5. Fill the five-quart jug full.
6. Pour the five-quart jug into the three-quart jug until full.
7. Now the five-quart jug has exactly four quarts of water.
