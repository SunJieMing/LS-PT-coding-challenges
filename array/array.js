/* Make a class called Array.
 * It should have the methods push, pop, get(index), and delete(index).
 * get and delete should accept an index and get or remove the item at that index.
 * Make sure to shift the array items after deleting an item.
 * In your implementation use a JS object to build the array.
 * Do NOT use an array as the underlying data structure, that's cheating :)
 * How do these operations compare to that of a linked list?
 * When would you want to use an array vs a linked list?
